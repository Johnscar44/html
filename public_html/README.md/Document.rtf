Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

  Welcome and thank you for checking out my webpage. In a effort to primarily
focus on my coding abilities, I have added placeholder text where necessary.
Some example content does exist but only to preview what type of
content could be expected as well as to give a general sense of purpose of the
site. I have tried my best to included all of the requirements for this project.
I hope you enjoy it.

  On the home page (index.html) I have a full CSS with multiple divs and
classes. For quite some time now I've been building PCs, both for profit and
hobby. Given that it's something I know very well I decided to fill an entire
webpage with information.  Each page is linked and reachable from all other
pages. As I worked my way through this project I learned a lot and at times 
had to double back and change things.  SASS was very useful on my second page
(parts.html). Seeing how it compiled the CSS helped me get more familiar with
CSS.

  My build page was made with the bootstrap column/grid model. I added a jump
link on the left and used it towards what would be a step by step build guide
with an easy way for the user to jump to the information they're looking for. I
believe I did the @media query correctly, considering I took it directly from
bootstrap CSS. The last page is merely a fun page where I played around with
different things.  I had a lot of fun doing this project and I'm excited to do
more.
